/**  The `getValue` method attempts to return the value associated with a given key from a map.
- If the key is not found, an exception is thrown (implicitly by `map.get(input)`, since it returns `null` if the key doesn't exist, and autoboxing a `null` to an `int` will throw a `NullPointerException`).
- If an exception is caught, the method checks if the number of retries (`numRetries`) is greater than 3. If it is, the method rethrows the exception. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself, increasing `numRetries` by 1.

### Scenario Analysis:

1. **getValue("foo", 0);**
    - The key "foo" exists in the map with a value of 1.
    - **Result:** 1, **Executions:** 1 time.
2. **getValue("bar", 2);**
    - The key "bar" exists in the map with a value of 3.
    - **Result:** 3, **Executions:** 1 time.
3. **getValue("baz", 0);**
    - The key "baz" does not exist in the map.
    - A `NullPointerException` is thrown, caught, and the method is retried.
    - This process repeats until `numRetries` exceeds 3. The first call counts as retry 0, then it increases with each recursion: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → (throw on the next attempt before it executes because the condition checks for `numRetries > 3`).
    - **Result:** Exception thrown after the 4th retry (i.e., the 5th invocation is never reached because the method throws an exception when `numRetries` is set to 4).
    - **Executions:** 4 times (with `numRetries` values 0, 1, 2, 3).
4. **getValue("fubar", 1);**
    - Similar to case (3), "fubar" does not exist, triggering retries.
    - Starts with `numRetries` = 1, then retries are: 1 → 2 → 3 → (throw on the next attempt).
    - **Result:** Exception thrown after the 3rd retry (i.e., when `numRetries` is set to 4, the check is made and the exception is thrown).
    - **Executions:** 3 times (with `numRetries` values 1, 2, 3).

For cases (3) and (4), the specific type of exception thrown would be a `NullPointerException` due to attempting to unbox a `null` value returned for a non-existent key. */
